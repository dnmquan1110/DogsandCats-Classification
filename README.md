# DogsandCats-Classification
This is a final project of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. Our group chooses to classfication dogs and cats by deep learning model using Tensorflow 2.

The deep learning model we choose in this project is ResNet (released by Microsoft). This is a basic deep leanring model used for computer vision. 

To make clear what features of dogs and cats does model use to classifcate them, we use GradCAM and visualize features use for classification.
